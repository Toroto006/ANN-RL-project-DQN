# Artificial Neural Networks: Epidemic Control Project

## Submission zip

The submission zip file contains the final [report](./ANN_Report_2023.pdf) and the notebook to create it in [allQuestions.ipynb](./allQuestions.ipynb).
The files ending in `.mdl` are the weight exports of our best models for the relevant question and the `.pickle` files are the training and evaluation traces.
Those two types of files are added to the submission for the reproducibility of the simulations and figures without the need to retrain all of the models.

## Full GitHub folder structure
Base project for the CS-456 Deep-Q learning for epidemic mitigation mini-project. This folder contains:

1. The *epidemic-mitigation environment library* (in the `epidemic_env` folder).
2. a tutorial notebook (`tutorial.ipynb`), to show you how to interact with the provided python modules.
3. The project questions and explanations in the `Miniproject_DQN.pdf` file.

Best luck!
